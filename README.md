this is the sky country unity game converted to a godot game. 
--
current focuses:
	
* dialogue
* initial combat implementation
* saving/loading games
* getting movement controls to feel good
* dynamically spawn items in certain areas on the floor
* architecture for sending data between gameplay and HUD
* make sure the editor workflow for creating pickupable objects is smooth and sensible

other side things:
* http audio stream
* start messing around with the 3d assets
* might be a good idea to make PlayerModel a [Resource](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/resources.html), for saving/loading
