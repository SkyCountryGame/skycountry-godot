## Components. 
### the purpose of this doc is help conceptualize components, and propose how they should be implemented. should they all be Nodes, Resources, or some of each? what values do they need to export?  

## how components work:
    - each component listens for state changes on the parent node to which it is attached, which must be a stateholder
    - it has some number of nodes (exported) upon which it acts, based on state change
    -
