problem: 
1. we need a performant way to do grass. do we use MultiMesh with an actual grass blade mesh? or grass chunks/patches? or do we use shaders entirely? what other options? 
2. terrain editing. need good way to do terrain editing in godot. Terrain3D looks good. 

look into:
- alpha cards
- data structure of mesh grass vs shader program
