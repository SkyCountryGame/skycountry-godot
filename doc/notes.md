immediate next steps:
    - component composition
    - event triggering and animations for dialogue? (low pri mitch) 
    - clarify notes on PRs

some random notes that are not yet categorized into specific doc files.

- what objects/systems in the game have "state" and need a "state machine" (constraints on attributes based on state, and things that need happen when transioning from state X to state Y)
    - player
    - enemy
    - NPC
    - level?
