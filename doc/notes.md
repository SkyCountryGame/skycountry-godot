thoughts during demo development:
    - are there ever any "stateless" nodes that have components?
    - i think usable is different from equippable
    - register gameobjects with all of the nodes that comprise the object
    - need to have a concept of "player quest state" / "progression through the story", for choosing which dialogue to use.
